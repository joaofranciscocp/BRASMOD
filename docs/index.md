# BRASMOD    
<div style="text-align: justify;">
BRASMOD is the first large-scale, open-access, tax-benefit microsimulation model for Brazil. Built within the EUROMOD software, our model encompasses the complete federal structure of taxes and benefits from 2008 to 2023, including the COVID-related benefits.

The preliminary results of BRASMOD and all the choices involved with developing the model are reunited in the Country Report, an obligatory document for EUROMOD-based models. You can download our Country Report here. Moreover, you may cite our Country Report when using BRASMOD:

## EUROMOD platform 
    
To run the model, you can download the latest version of the EUROMOD software [here](https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/download-euromod).

The [EUROMOD](https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) platform is maintained, developed, and managed by the Joint Research Centre ([JRC](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en)) of the European Commission. EUROMOD is a purpose-built software that offers an ideal platform for developing microsimulation models. You can find a series of resources related to the EUROMOD platform (like training courses and detailed manuals) and the EUROMOD models [here](https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resources). 

UNU-WIDER has also launched [SOUTHMOD](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/southmod-simulating-tax-and-benefit-policies-development-phase-2), a research project that developed a bundle of tax-benefit microsimulation models for selected developing countries. You can apply for access to the SOUTHMOD bundle [here](https://www.wider.unu.edu/about/accessing-southmod-models). 

## Data
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The microdata sets used to run the model were built using the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domcílios (PNAD) until 2015, and the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios contínua (PNADc) from 2015 onwards. PNAD and its quarterly version, PNADc, are the main national household surveys conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The model also uses data from the nationally representative budget survey Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares (POF), for 2008 and 2018.
